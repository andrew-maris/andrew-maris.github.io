The "density limit" is one of the fundamental bounds on tokamak operating space, and is commonly estimated via the empirical Greenwald scaling. This limit has garnered renewed interest in recent years as it has become clear that ITER and many tokamak pilot plant concepts must operate near or above the widelyused Greenwald limit to achieve their objectives. Evidence has also grown that the Greenwald scaling - in its remarkable simplicity - may not capture the full complexity of the disruptive density limit. In this study, we assemble a multi-machine database to quantify the effectiveness of the Greenwald limit as a predictor of the L-mode density limit and identify alternative stability metrics. We find that a two-parameter dimensionless boundary in the plasma edge achieves significantly higher accuracy (true negative rate of 97.7% at a true positive rate of 95%) than the Greenwald limit (true negative rate 86.1% at a true positive rate of 95%) across a multimachine dataset including metal- and carbon-wall tokamaks (AUG, C-Mod, DIII-D, and TCV). The collisionality boundary presented here can be applied for density limit avoidance in current devices and in ITER, where it can be measured and responded to in real time.
