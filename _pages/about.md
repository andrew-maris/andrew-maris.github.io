**Dr. Andrew D. Maris** is a DOE Fusion Energy Sciences Postdoctoral Fellow at Columbia University, where he works with Prof. Carlos Paz-Soldan on understanding transient off-normal phenomena in magnetically confined fusion plasmas.

Andrew earned his B.A. from Carleton College in 2019 and his Ph.D. from the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center in 2026, where his doctoral research was advised by Cristina Rea, Robert Granetz, and Earl Marmar. His thesis focused on using machine-learning methods to understand, predict, and ultimately avoid the density limit in tokamak fusion reactors.

In addition to plasma physics, Andrew has active research interests in fusion energy economics and policy, including published work on the impact of plasma disruptions on the cost of fusion power plants. He is also a co-founder and former President of the [Fusion Student Delegation](https://www.fusiondelegation.org/), a student-led organization connecting early-career researchers with policymakers and stakeholders in the fusion ecosystem.
