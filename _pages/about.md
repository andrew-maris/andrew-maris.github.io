Andrew D. Maris is a PhD Candidate at the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center. As a plasma physicist and data scientist, Andrew's research leverages machine learning to understand, predict, and avoid disruptive instabilities in tokamak plasmas. His interests also extends to economic and policy questions, where he has studied the impact disruptions may have on the economics of a tokamak power plant.

Andrew recieved a Bachelor's degree from Carleton College in 2019 with a major in Physics (*with distinction*) and a minor in Public Policy. At Carleton, he researched quantum chaos with Professor Arjendu Pattanayak, which inspired his TEDx talk [What Jurassic Park Gets Wrong About Chaos Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD1M2DkrI4c&t=4s). After graudating, Andrew performed research at the National Ignition Facility with mentor Dr. Shahab Khan, identifying correlations in inertial confinement fusion experiment performance using machine learning. He then briefly worked on photonics and quantum technology at L3Harris in Palm Bay, Florida, before starting his PhD in the Nuclear Science and Engineering Department at MIT.
