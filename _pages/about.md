Andrew D. Maris is a Ph.D. Candidate at the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center advised by Cristina Rea, Robert Granetz, and Earl Marmar. Andrew's research leverages machine learning to understand, predict, and avoid the density limit in tokamak fusion reactors. His interests also extend to economic and policy questions, where he has published on the impact disruptions on the cost of fusion energy and currently serves as President of the [Fusion Student Delegation](https://www.fusiondelegation.org/).

Education & Experience
========

Andrew received a Bachelor's degree from Carleton College in 2019 with a major in Physics and a minor in Public Policy. At Carleton, he researched quantum chaos with Professor Arjendu Pattanayak. After graduating, Andrew performed research at the National Ignition Facility with mentor Dr. Shahab Khan, identifying correlations in the performance of inertial confinement fusion experiments using data-driven techniques. He then briefly worked on photonics and quantum technology at L3Harris in Palm Bay, Florida, before starting his PhD in the Nuclear Science and Engineering Department at MIT.

Research
========

Today, Andrew's research focuses on the "density limit" instability, one of the key operational limits in factors in tokamaks. He explores data-driven methods to potentially unlock a deeper understanding of the physics of the instability and real-time control solutions for high density reactor scenarios.
