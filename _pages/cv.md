Education
======
* **Massachusetts Institute of Technology**, Cambridge, MA (2020 - Present)
  * Ph.D. in Applied Plasma Physics, Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering
  * Advisors: Drs. Cristina Rea, Robert Granetz, and Earl Marmar
* **Carleton College**, Northfield, MN (2015 - 2019)
  * B.A. in Physics (*Distinction*), minor in Public Policy 


Professional experience
======
* **Ph.D. Candidate/Research Assistant**, MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center (2020 - Present)
  * Identified novel stability boundary for the L-mode density limit using data-driven methods that achieves greater prediction accuracy than the Greenwald limit
  * Constructed a density limit database with 150+ events from AUG, C-Mod, DIII-D, and TCV
  *	Demonstrated real-time density limit avoidance on DIII-D utilizing stability boundary
  *	Advised by Cristina Rea, Robert Granetz, and Earl Marmar


* **National Ignition Facility (NIF) Summer Scholar**, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Summer 2019 & 2020)
  * Developed machine learning models to predict neutron yield of inertial confinement fusion experiments at the NIF and provide an insight into yield degradation mechanisms
  * Supervisor: Dr. Shahab Khan
