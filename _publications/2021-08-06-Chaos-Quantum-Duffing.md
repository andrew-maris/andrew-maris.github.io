excerpt: 'We study the quantum dissipative Duffinng oscillator across a range of system sizes and environ-
mental couplings under varying semiclassical approximations. Remarkably, we find that a parametrically invariant meta-
attractor emerges at a specific length scale and noise-added classical models deviate strongly from
quantum dynamics below this scale. Our findings also generalize the previous surprising result that
classically regular orbits can have the greatest quantum-classical differences in the semiclassical
regime. In particular, we show that the dynamical growth of quantum-classical differences is not
determined by the degree of classical chaos.'

We study the quantum dissipative Duffng oscillator across a range of system sizes and environ-
mental couplings under varying semiclassical approximations. Using spatial (based on Kullback-
Leibler distances between phase-space attractors) and temporal (Lyapunov exponent-based) com-
plexity metrics, we isolate the effect of the environment on quantum-classical differences. Moreover,
we quantify the system sizes where quantum dynamics cannot be simulated using semiclassical or
noise-added classical approximations. Remarkably, we find that a parametrically invariant meta-
attractor emerges at a specific length scale and noise-added classical models deviate strongly from
quantum dynamics below this scale. Our findings also generalize the previous surprising result that
classically regular orbits can have the greatest quantum-classical differences in the semiclassical
regime. In particular, we show that the dynamical growth of quantum-classical differences is not
determined by the degree of classical chaos.
